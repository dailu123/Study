The "dag_level" object in this JSON represents the configuration for the first level of tasks that will be triggered by our Airflow program, which we call "auto trigger". These tasks will make API requests to a downstream system using the specified HTTP connection ID, HTTP method, endpoint, and data payload. The purpose of this configuration is to specify the details of the API requests that need to be made and the order in which they should be triggered. By defining this configuration in the "dag_level" object, we can easily add, modify, or remove tasks in this level as needed.
