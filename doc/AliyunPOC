Epic Title: Flink-RocketMQ Integration for Message Forwarding

Feature Title: Message Forwarding from RocketMQ to Another RocketMQ Topic using Flink

Feature Description: This feature aims to enable message forwarding from a source RocketMQ topic to a target RocketMQ topic using Flink. The feature will involve the following tasks:

Configure the RocketMQ source connector to read messages from the source RocketMQ topic.
Develop a Flink pipeline to consume messages from the source RocketMQ topic and transform them as per requirements.
Configure the RocketMQ sink connector to write the transformed messages to the target RocketMQ topic.
Test the integration to ensure reliable message forwarding with no data loss.
Provide documentation and training materials to facilitate the use and maintenance of the integrated system.
Note: This feature is part of the larger Epic titled "Establishing a Flink-RocketMQ Link", which aims to provide a proof of concept for integrating Flink and RocketMQ for various use cases.


In the context of real-time data processing for a financial institution, as a risk analyst, I want to filter and re-structure incoming messages from a RocketMQ topic using Flink, in order to identify and mitigate potential financial risks.

To achieve this, I need to have a system in place that can consume data from the RocketMQ topic, apply certain filters to extract only relevant information, and then re-structure the data in a format that is suitable for my analysis. The system should be able to handle a high volume of messages and provide real-time processing capabilities to ensure that I can detect risks as soon as possible.

By integrating Flink with RocketMQ, I can build a system that meets these requirements. Flink's stream processing capabilities enable me to apply filters and transform data in real-time, while RocketMQ's messaging system ensures that the messages are reliably delivered to the system. This integration will help me to identify potential financial risks as soon as they arise, which will enable me to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks and protect the interests of the financial institution.


Acceptance Criteria Details:

The system should be able to consume messages from the source RocketMQ topic and apply the specified filters to extract relevant information.
The system should be able to re-structure the filtered data into a suitable format for downstream users.
The system should write the restructured data to the target RocketMQ topic reliably with no data loss.
The system should be able to handle high volumes of incoming messages and provide real-time processing capabilities.
Downstream users should be able to use the restructured data for their specific use cases.
Detail Steps:

Set up and configure Flink and RocketMQ to integrate with each other.
Create a Flink job to consume messages from the source RocketMQ topic and apply the specified filters to extract relevant information.

In the context of a company that provides real-time messaging services, as a user, I want to be able to filter incoming messages based on a combination of fixed and dynamic filtering criteria, including data from MaxComputer tables, in order to provide relevant data to downstream users in a timely and efficient manner.

The use case involves implementing a Flink job that receives messages from a RocketMQ topic, applies filtering criteria based on both the message content and data from MaxComputer tables, and then forwards the filtered messages to a downstream RocketMQ topic.

The key requirements for this use case are as follows:

The system should be able to handle a high volume of incoming messages and provide real-time processing capabilities.

Business Story:
In the context of a large-scale streaming application, as a developer, I want to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for our Flink application, so that we can seamlessly handle Flink instance failures without any data loss.

Use Case:
To achieve high availability and fault tolerance for our Flink application, we want to implement a Flink Resilient POC that can run multiple Flink instances and ensure that if one instance goes down, the other instances can take over its tasks without losing any data. This will allow us to avoid any downtime or data loss, and provide a seamless experience for our users even in the event of instance failures.

By implementing this POC, we can also verify the scalability and performance of our Flink application and ensure that it can handle large volumes of data in real-time without any issues.
