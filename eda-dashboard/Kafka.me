Here’s the corrected version of your text:

"The CFK is our key service, and we need to identify several metrics from it. Please find the metrics below:

Subscriber status for each consumer group subscribing to each topic.
Accumulated messages for each consumer group.
Produce/consume latency.
Produce/consume volume."
Let me know if you need further adjustments!

Here are some additional Kafka metrics you might want to track, depending on your use case:

Consumer Lag: The lag of each consumer group, which indicates how far behind they are in processing messages relative to the latest message in the topic.

Message Processing Time: The average time it takes for a message to be processed by a consumer after being produced to a Kafka topic.

Broker Health: Metrics on the health of the Kafka brokers, including the number of active brokers, broker availability, and broker disk usage.

Partition Reassignment: Tracking of any partition reassignments, which can indicate potential issues with load balancing.

Under-replicated Partitions: The number of partitions that have fewer than the expected number of replicas, which could indicate replication issues.

Disk I/O and Memory Usage: Monitoring the disk I/O and memory consumption of Kafka brokers to ensure they aren't becoming resource-constrained.

Producer Error Rate: The rate at which producers are encountering errors while producing messages (e.g., failed requests, timeouts).

Consumer Throughput: The rate at which messages are consumed by each consumer group.

Active Connections: The number of active producer and consumer connections to each Kafka broker.

Topic Size: The total size of each topic, which can help with capacity planning and detecting bottlenecks.

Replication Lag: How far behind the replicas are compared to the leader, indicating any replication delays.

Message Retention: The rate at which messages are being deleted from topics based on retention policies.
